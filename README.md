# FootInsights App

As the name suggests, the **FootInsights** app provides insights into the status of football players, helping coaches make informed decisions regarding their players. The insights include player conditions such as:
- **Risk of injury**
- **Pause**
- **Fatigue**
- **Dehydration**

These insights help coaches predict players' conditions, making strategic decisions based on the data.

## Features

1. **Dashboard for Player Status**: 
   - A dashboard feature displays the status of each player, offering real-time information about their health and game readiness.

2. **Player Management**: 
   - The app includes a component to manage players, allowing coaches to **add**, **edit**, and **delete** players as needed.

3. **Conversational Chatbot**: 
   - A chatbot component enables coaches to have a conversational interaction, simplifying the decision-making process by providing insights and suggestions.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Developed using **Django**, which powers the applicationâ€™s server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: Built using **React** and **Refine**, offering a flexible and user-friendly interface.
- **Database**: The app uses **MongoDB** for storing player data and other relevant information.

## Future Improvements

In the future, the project will be enhanced by:
- **Real-Time Data**: 
   - The goal is to implement real-time data processing, enabling coaches to make decisions during the match with real-time player insights.
  
- **Real-Time Chatbot**:
   - The chatbot will be upgraded to analyze data in real time and provide responses dynamically based on current game conditions.
